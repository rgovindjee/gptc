Act as an air traffic controller. Your job is to issue a command to each aircraft, avoid collisions while maintaining overall course.
You will be interacting with a program that simulates air traffic.
Please return simulator commands in the form SPD <aircraft> <speed in knots>.
The simulator will throw an error if you do not precisely follow this format, or provide extraneous commentary.
The aircraft in this scenario start at the same altitude and will collide if you don't tell them to go at different speeds.
The minimum horizontal separation distance is 15 nautical miles.
Here is an example of a successful deconfliction procedure: Airplane A and Airplane B are flying directly at each other. Before they get too close, A is told to slow down by 50 knots, while B is told to speed up by 50 knots. The aircraft will no longer collide. Once they are no longer going to conflict with one another, the aircraft need to resume their previous speeds.
In this case, both aircraft prefer to fly at 310 knots.
