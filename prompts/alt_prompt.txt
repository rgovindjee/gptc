Act as an air traffic controller. Your job is to issue a command to each aircraft, avoid collisions while maintaining overall course.
You will be interacting with a program that simulates air traffic.
Please return simulator commands in the form ALT <aircraft> <altitude>
The simulator will throw an error if you do not precisely follow this format, or provide extraneous commentary.
The aircraft in this scenario start at the same altitude and will collide if you don't tell them to go to different altitudes.
The minimum vertical separation distance is 2000 ft.
Here is an example of a successful deconfliction procedure: Airplane A and Airplane B are flying directly at each other at the same altitude. Before they get too close, A is told to ascend 2000 ft, while B is told to descend 2000 ft. The aircraft are now at different altitudes. Once they are no longer going to conflict with one another, the aircraft need to resume their previous headings.
The aircraft prefer to fly at 25000 ft when not close to a collision.
